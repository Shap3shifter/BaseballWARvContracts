Data Science Final Project on Baseball Player WAR and its relation to their contract

## Project Overview

There are many different metrics to measure how good or valuable a baseball player is throughout a season. One such metric is Wins Above Replacement or WAR. 

WAR is an attempt by the sabermetric baseball community to summarize a player’s total contributions to their team in one statistic. You should always use more than one metric at a time when evaluating players, but WAR is all-inclusive and provides a useful reference point for comparing players. 

WAR offers an estimate to answer the question, “If this player got injured and their team had to replace them with a freely available minor leaguer or a AAAA player from their bench, how much value would the team be losing?” 

This value is expressed in a wins format, so we could say that Player X is worth +6.3 wins to their team while Player Y is only worth +3.5 wins, which means it is highly likely that Player X has been more valuable than Player Y.

Now that we have a general understanding of WAR, that leads up to our project objective and hypothesis. 


## Objective: 

How does an established baseball player's WAR move (increases/decreases/stays the same) in relation to completion of their multi-year contract? 

## Why did we select this topic? 


## Hypothesis (question(s) we hope to answer with the data):

We believe that most baseball player's WAR will be at its peak towards the end of their contract because players will want to maximize their value for their next potential contract.

## Communication Methods

For this project we are using Discord as a means to centralize information shared and facilitate group video calls. 
Our group has agreed upon to meet outside of class times, Wednesdays and at least one weekend day. 

## Resources

(I just added everything from the discord. Let me know what we can remove. Also, I could use some help knowing what was pulled from each source for our dataset).

## Creating our Dataset

Def need a group effort here to recount what we added/subtracted and why.
